# Override global `draft` class. For example, perhaps you want your own class at
# `app/models/draft.rb` that adds extra attributes, validations, associations,
# methods, etc. Be sure that this new model class extends `Draftsman::Single::Draft` or `Draftsman::Multiple::Draft`.
# Draftsman.draft_class_name = 'Draftsman::Single::Draft'

# Serializer for `object`, `object_changes`, and `previous_draft` columns. To
# use the JSON serializer, change to `Draftsman::Serializers::Json`. You could
# implement your own serializer if you really wanted to. See files in
# `lib/draftsman/serializers`.
#
# Note: this option is not needed if you're using the PostgreSQL JSON data type
# for the `object`, `object_changes`, and `previous_draft` columns.
# Draftsman.serializer = Draftsman::Serializers::Json

# Field which records when a draft was created.
# Draftsman.timestamp_field = :created_at

# Field which records who last recorded the draft.

# Whether or not to stash draft data in the `Draftsman::Single::Draft` record. If set to
# `false`, all changes will be persisted to the main record and will not be
# persisted to the draft record's `object` column.
